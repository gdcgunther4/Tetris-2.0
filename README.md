# Tetris-2.0
This is my take on the classic game of Tetris.
To run this program, run the file Tetris 2.0, which calls on functions from the other three programs.
It uses pygame to create all the graphics. Tetris beginner is normal Tetris, while Tetris_Intermeddiate and Tetris_Advanced are my own creations.
